# Transforming Spatial Data using modular 3D tools {.exercise}


1. Tell us if you use 3D visualization or meshes in analysis. 


This is hard! There's a few scattered tools. 

## On CRAN 

mesh3d in rgl

sfdct to triangulate simple features

quadmesh to create rgl-ready mesh3d

decido to triangulate simple features (only suitable for plane-filling, because ugly triangles)

mapview::cubeView 

## Stuff not on CRAN!

hypertidy/silicate, hypertidy/anglr - these are evolving together 

MilesMcBain/r2vr, MilesMcBain/r2vr.gis

SymbolixAU/mapdeck
